Hardware serial library for AVR microcontrollers that have built-in USART.

I wrote this to have easy serial IO for AVR microcontrollers that have built-in USARTs.
Provides character input/output and string output, as well as a convenient debugging macro.
See main.c as an example on how to use this library.
